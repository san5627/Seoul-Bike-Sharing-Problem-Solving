# Seoul-Bike-Sharing-Problem-Solving-
This project presents a Improvement Of Seoul Bike Sharing Linear Model Using Feature Engineering, Model Selection And Gradient Descent. Nowadays, rental bikes are introduced to the public in almost all the top urban cities in the world for enhancement of mobile comfort ability and environmental factors [1]. The most important part is the prediction of bike counts or bike availability at a certain point at an hourly basis for stable supply of rental bikes. The dataset includes weather information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, dew point, solar radiation, rainfall etc. This project explores the application of Linear Regression models for predicting bike count for meeting the necessary demands. This paper discusses the models for hourly rental bike demand prediction
